#Stroke Prediction Project

1. Source of data

     Source of Data is a Kaggle Data Set

2. Brief description of data

    According to the World Health Organization (WHO) stroke is the 2nd leading cause of death globally, responsible for approximately 11% of total deaths.
    This dataset is used to predict whether a patient is likely to get stroke based on the input parameters like gender, age, various diseases, and smoking status. Each row in the data provides relavant information about the patient.

3. What is the target?

  The target is 'stroke'

4. What does one row represent? (A person?  A business?  An event? A product?)

  Each Row is a person

5. Is this a classification or regression problem?

  Classification Problem

6. How many features does the data have?

  Five total features

7. How many rows are in the dataset?

  5110 Rows in the Data Set

8. What, if any, challenges do you foresee in cleaning, exploring, or modeling this dataset?

  The amount of data is sufficient. Challenges I forsee is choosing the proper features for the target. Lots of two choice columns without a lot of variance.
